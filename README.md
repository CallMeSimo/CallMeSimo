## Synopsis
Coder, programmer and any other synonym for it, thats me!

Young[19M] and ambitous, I do a lot of projects and publish them here on Github for people to see and review!
Most of my experience is on web-development[Javascript, Php, HTML, CSS] and do my projects with the React library. I have used other frameworks / library such as bootstrap, laravel etc but I am currently focusing on React.

I have done a lot of collaberation projects, been team-lead on most of them actually, meaning I am no stranger to working in teams and organizing tasks.

If there is anything, and I mean ANYTHING...
